Frogger Arcade Game

Summary

This project is a part of the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree and it involves replicating the classic arcade game, Frogger.

Goal

The goal of this game is very simple. You, as a player, must manuever through a track of enemies without colliding with them. Once you reach the other side of the track, you will score a point and your character will reset to its original location. Once you reach a score of 5, you can congratulate yourself because you have achieved the "win" condition of the game. I put win in quotations because you may keep on playing after that, and the game is only ever truly over once you feel like ending it.


Movement

You may move the character with your arrow keys

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
